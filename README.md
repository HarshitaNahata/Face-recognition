It is a type of biometrics, which is the automated identification of individuals based on their physical characteristics.

Face recognition can be done in Python using a variety of libraries, including:

OpenCV: OpenCV is a popular open-source library for computer vision. It includes a face detection and recognition module that can be used to identify faces in images and videos.
face_recognition: face_recognition is a Python library that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for face recognition. It is based on the dlib library, which is a popular machine learning library for face recognition.
